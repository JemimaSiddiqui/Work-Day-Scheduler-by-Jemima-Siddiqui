# 05 About the Project - Work Day Scheduler

The Work Day Scheduler application consists of a daily planner that can be filled out by a user to keep track of hourly-based tasks. By using this application, the user is able to save events for each hour of the work day (9am-5pm). This application runs in the browser and the features are dynamically updated by HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
